# Buddy-Finder-Application
This application is designed for native android phones. It is a perfect application for trekkers and explorers. In this app, you can create your own group and start your exploration/trekking. The admin's path is highlighted on the map so that when a newbie is lost, he/she can see the path and follow it.

The admin can set the destination of the group. For setting a point as destination, he needs to long tap on the point and confirm it.

Setting a destination is not a compulsion, but it gives an idea to the team where we are going.
Now we can see ourselves on the map.
